A remix of "Witcher towel hook/key holder (full)" by Vladeer, fresh off the forge of Kaer Morhen.

This remix adds a dovetail slide wall mount back plate. Mount the back plate and slide the medallion key hook into place. The dovetail rail on the back plate is designed a hair smaller than the front pieces' back-inlet so you shouldn't have any trouble sliding it on if it's cleaned up nicely.

"I manage because I have to. Because I've no other way out. Because I've overcome the vanity and pride of being different. I've understood that they are a pitiful defense against being different.” – Geralt
