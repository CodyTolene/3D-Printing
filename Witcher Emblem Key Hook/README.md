### Description

Introducing the exquisite Witcher Emblem, forged with precision at Kaer Morhen. This mountable masterpiece boasts a dovetail slide wall mount back plate, allowing you to effortlessly attach and slide the medallion key hook into place. The meticulous design ensures a perfect fit, as the dovetail rail on the back plate is crafted slightly smaller than the back-inlet of the front piece. With a little cleaning, you'll experience seamless sliding without any hassle.
